        <p>
          Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website
          background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a
          3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and
          creating a more immersive browsing experience. Parallax is based on
          optical illusion. Parallax scrolling allows us to immerse our website
          visitors in unique online experiences. It's even possible to create a
          one-page website where visitors can read an entire story about your
          product or brand without navigating to multiple pages.

        <p>The sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is an annual plant with a large daisy-like flower face. 
        Its scientific name comes from the Greek words helios (“sun”) and anthos (“flower”). The flowers come in many colors (yellow, red, orange, maroon, brown), 
            but they are commonly bright yellow with brown centers that ripen into heavy heads filled with seeds. </p>
<!-- <p>The Amazon rainforest plays an important part in regulating the world's oxygen and carbon cycles. 
It produces roughly 6 percent of the world's oxygen and has long been thought to act as a carbon 
sink, meaning it readily absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Length: 6,992 km , The researchers found the Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river some 
11 million years ago</p> -->

<p>The touch me not plant is generally cultivated as an indoor yearly plant, and once in a while as a groundcover. 
Proliferation is finished by seed mostly. It arises wholly in soil that is poor-nutrition that sanctions 
consistent water drainage and seepage. No matter how sensitive these plants are to touch, they can be planted as an 
indoor plant at home. Watering should be reduced during the season of winter.The touch me not flower looks the same as 
fluffy balls which are pink in colour, hence presenting them as alluring and attractive.</p>
